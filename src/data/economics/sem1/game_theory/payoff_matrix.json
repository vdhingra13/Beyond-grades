    {
      "question": "In a 2×2 payoff matrix, each cell shows:",

      "explanation": "A profile (s_A, s_B) maps to an ordered pair (u_A, u_B)."

      "question": "If Player B chooses Column 1, Player A comparing Row 1 payoff 4 vs Row 2 payoff 2 should choose:",

        "Mix 50–50",
        "Cannot say"

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Best response is the higher payoff: 4 > 2 → Row 1."
