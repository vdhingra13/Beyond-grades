    {
      "question": "A dominant strategy for a player is one that:",
      "options": [
        "Maximizes the rival’s payoff",
        "Yields the highest payoff regardless of the opponent’s move",
        "Minimizes variance",
        "Always cooperates"
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Dominance is payoff-maximization independent of opponents."
    },
    {
      "question": "If A’s payoffs by rows against any column are (5 vs 3), A’s dominant choice is:",
      "options": [
        "Row with payoff 3",
        "Row with payoff 5",
        "Randomize",
        "None"
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "5 > 3 for every column → that row dominates."

      "question": "Dominant strategies:",
      "options": [
        "Always exist",

        "Guarantee Pareto efficiency",
        "Eliminate best responses"

      "question": "The Prisoner’s Dilemma features:",
      "options": [
        "No dominant strategies",
        "A dominant strategy for only one player",
        "Dominant strategies for both players",

      "question": "If only Player A has a dominant strategy, equilibrium will be:",
      "options": [

        "Pareto optimum",

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "B best-responds to A’s dominant choice → a Nash equilibrium."

        "Opponent’s payoffs",

        "Dominant strategy simplifies decision-making",
        "Dominant strategy may be inefficient collectively",
        "Dominant strategy always exists",
        "Dominant strategy is independent of the opponent’s move"
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Dominant strategies often do not exist."

    {
      "question": "If two strategies give identical payoffs in every column, then:",
      "options": [
        "Both dominate each other",
        "They are equivalent for the player",
        "Neither is a best response",
        "Mixing strictly dominates"
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "They are payoff-equivalent; either can be chosen."

      "question": "Weak dominance means:",
      "options": [
        "A strategy is better in all cases",
        "A strategy is at least as good in all cases and strictly better in some",
        "Strategies are incomparable",
        "A dominated strategy is optimal"

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Weakly dominant ≥ in all states, > in some."
