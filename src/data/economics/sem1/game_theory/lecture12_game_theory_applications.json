    {
      "question": "In a Hawk–Dove game, each player can fight (Hawk) or yield (Dove). If the value of the resource is 6 and the cost of conflict is 8, what is each player’s expected payoff if both choose Hawk?",
      "options": [
        "–1",
        "0",
        "2",
        "3"
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Each receives (6−8)/2 = −1 because they split the resource but both pay the conflict cost. The outcome is mutually harmful."
    },
    {
      "question": "Suppose Player 1 plays Hawk with probability α and Player 2 is indifferent. If Player 2’s payoff from Hawk is 2−8α and from Dove is 6(1−α), what is α at equilibrium?",
      "options": [
        "0.4",
        "0.5",
        "0.6",
        "0.8"
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Set payoffs equal: 2−8α = 6(1−α) → 2−8α = 6−6α → 2α = 4 → α = 0.5. Both randomize equally between Hawk and Dove."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a symmetric Hawk–Dove equilibrium, what does the mixed strategy represent?",
      "options": [
        "Random conflict probability maintaining indifference",
        "Preference for dominance",
        "Repeated cooperation over time",
        "No stable equilibrium"
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The mixed strategy α keeps each player indifferent between playing Hawk or Dove, balancing aggression and peace probabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "In an entry deterrence game, if AI Co’s entry payoff is 4−β and the incumbent’s reaction cost is 3β, what β makes the entrant indifferent between entering and staying out?",
      "options": [
        "1",
        "1.5",
        "2",
        "3"
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Set entry payoff 4−β = 0 (stay out value). Solving gives β=1. A higher β means entry becomes less attractive."
    },
    {
      "question": "When an incumbent commits to high output to deter entry, it is using which strategic mechanism?",
      "options": [
        "First-mover advantage",
        "Dominated strategy",
        "Capacity precommitment",
        "Grim trigger"
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "By building capacity before entry, the incumbent credibly threatens low post-entry prices — a precommitment device."
    },
    {
      "question": "A government subsidy reducing DataCorp’s fixed cost from 6 to 3 changes the Nash equilibrium how?",
      "options": [
        "Entry becomes more likely",
        "Entry becomes less likely",
        "No effect on entry decision",
        "Both firms exit"
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A subsidy raises DataCorp’s expected profit upon entry, shifting best responses toward entering the market."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma, cooperation can be sustained if δ ≥ threshold. If the one-time gain from defection is 4 and the future loss from punishment is 6, what is the minimum δ?",
      "options": [
        "0.25",
        "0.4",
        "0.5",
        "0.67"
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Defection payoff = 4 now vs. cooperative stream δ×6/(1−δ). Cooperation stable if 6δ/(1−δ) ≥ 4 → δ ≥ 0.5."
    },
    {
      "question": "If players are impatient (low δ), what happens to cooperation in repeated games?",
      "options": [
        "It strengthens",
        "It weakens",
        "It becomes dominant",
        "It stays constant"
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Low δ means future rewards matter less, so the incentive to cooperate today weakens — patience supports trust."
    },
    {
      "question": "The grim-trigger strategy sustains cooperation by:",
      "options": [
        "Rewarding after each cooperation",
        "Forgiving occasional defection",
        "Punishing forever after any defection",
        "Switching randomly between cooperate and defect"
      ],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Once a player defects, grim trigger switches permanently to defection, making the threat of punishment credible and severe."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a trade relationship repeated infinitely, cooperation can persist if δ is high because:",
      "options": [
        "Future payoffs outweigh one-time cheating gains",
        "Punishment loses effect over time",
        "Players forget history",
        "Short-term profit dominates"
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "When δ is high, the value of future cooperation exceeds the short-term gain from cheating, aligning incentives to sustain trust."
